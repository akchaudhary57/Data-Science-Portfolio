# Project:- COMP6200 Data Science Portfolio 



### Portfolio 1

#### Analyzing Cycling data 

__Dataset:-__ The data set is an export of [Strava](https://strava.com/) and  [GoldenCheetah](https://www.goldencheetah.org/), an online social networking site for cycling and other sport. 

__Plotting and vistualization:-__ This Portfolio provides summary of cycling data which includes plotting histograms, heatmap, and subplots to represent clear and concise visualization of cycling data.


### Portfolio 2

#### Analyzing COVID-19 data

__Dataset:-__ The data is being made available by Johns Hopkins University in this [GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).The plotting is performed for the confirmed cases. The portfolio shows visualization and analysis of COVID cases across several countries through line graph.
Following feature has also been implemented:-

__Running Bar graph__:- Top 10 Counties With COVID-19 Cases Per Million [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BAj7PpHFgU). It is also available in the dataset.

__Simple linear model to predict COVID cases particularly in US and China__:- It contains simple linear model techniques to predict the log of the number of case across US. Also, the reason for China's data not showing exponential growth and it's act to stop the virus.

### Portfolio 3

#### Predicting the genre of Books

__Dataset:-__ We have use a set of book summeries from the [CMU Book Summaries Corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbamman/booksummaries.html). It contains a large number of summaries (16,559) and includes meta-data about the genre of the books taken from Freebase.

__Model used:-__ We have used MultiNomial NB model and Logistic Regression to predict the model. 

__Libraries:-__

 __TfidfVectorizer:-__ We have used this library to convert a collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF (Term frequency and Inverse Document Frequency).
